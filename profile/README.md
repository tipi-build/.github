### Ok cool! But what's that `tipi` thing?

`tipi` is a build tool, currently best suited for C and C++ developers.

Some of the things we do:

- 🫶 ease your dev life
- 📦 ship preconfigured tools to get started really fast (**< 10mins we promise!**)
- 🔍 scan your source code and generate (`cmake`) build scripts out of them
- 🔗 make it really easy to reference dependencies straight from Github: [here's how](https://tipi.build/explore/dependencies-from-github)
- 💾 auto-magically cache your builds
- ☁️ (optionally) the [tipi.build subscription](https://tipi.build/) provides really powerful and stable cloud environments to make builds even faster
